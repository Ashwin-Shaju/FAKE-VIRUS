# 🔐 Ethical Hacking Mini Project – Malware Simulation (BSOD + Popup Lock)

## 📌 Project Overview

This Python script is a **non-destructive simulation of scareware or ransomware-like behavior** designed for ethical hacking demonstrations. It mimics some malicious actions such as:

- Disabling Task Manager
- Killing `explorer.exe` (removes desktop/taskbar)
- Displaying looping warning pop-ups
- Triggering a forced **Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)**
- Booting into **Advanced Recovery Mode**

⚠️ **No files are deleted, modified, or encrypted** — the project is purely for educational and demonstrative use in **virtual machines** or **controlled environments**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate how malware can manipulate system APIs
- Show privilege escalation and crash techniques
- Simulate real malware behavior without actual destruction
- Practice safe malware analysis in VMs

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Endless pop-up dialogs with randomized scare messages
- Disables Task Manager using the Windows registry
- Kills Windows Explorer to simulate a system freeze
- BSOD triggered by:
  - Clicking "No" once
  - Clicking "Yes" 15 times
- Forces restart into Windows Recovery Options

## 🚀 How to Run

> 🧪 **Only run this on a Virtual Machine or test environment.**

1. **Make sure you are on Windows.**
2. **Run the script as administrator.**
3. The system will:
   - Disable Task Manager
   - Kill the desktop/taskbar
   - Begin showing pop-up boxes
4. Click "Yes" 15 times or "No" once → triggers BSOD and restarts to Advanced Startup.

## 🛠️ Cleanup Instructions

If you'd like to restore your system manually:

- **Re-enable Task Manager:**

  ```cmd
  REG DELETE HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v DisableTaskMgr /f

## you can convert this to an exe by using pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile reboot.py
